# RNNfromScratch

This project was created solely for the purpose of understanding the core concepts including the mathematics of RNN. The model may not work accurately.<br>
To create this Neural Network with a purpose of text generation. We take a dataset form kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews <br>
The following steps were performed:
<li>
  <ol>1. Find all the words in the entire dataset</ol>
  <ol>2. Make a dictionary assigning each word a number</ol>
  <ol>3. Next, making sentence vectors and writing functions for making one hot enocdings of each words</ol>
</li>
